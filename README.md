Freedom of Information Requests in the Region of Waterloo
The Waterloo Region strives to be open, transparent and accountable to citizens. Through a number of projects and initiatives, the Region is empowering citizens to become more engaged and to access government information. https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regional-government/open-government.aspx

One of those initiatives is Open Data. With this, the Region shares its data for everyone to use and republish with few restrictions. The data is provided in machine-readable format.

While searching the Region's Open Data Portal, one finds the Freedom of Information Requests (FOIR) data set. This data set spans 18 years. https://rowopendata-rmw.opendata.arcgis.com/

So let's find what this set holds and see if one can use machine learning to predict the outcome of a request based on the decisions made between 1999 and 2016.
